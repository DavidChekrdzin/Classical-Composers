# Classical-Composers

You can select different composers using the combo box in order to listen to their work or learn more about them. The music can be played, paused and reset to the beginning of the song. There is also a progress bar so you can see the progress of the song and a volume slider if the music is too loud for you. When you select a composer you are presented with some basic information about them (including a picture, basic info, long description, and some interesting and funny quotes), and the song they composed starts playing.

### To run the Classical Composers application:

Download the repository.

Open the project with IntelliJ using JDK19 and wait until IntelliJ indexes and downloads all the needed files.

Run the application using the main method inside ClassicalComposers\ClassicalComposers\src\main\java\com\example\classicalcomposers\HelloApplication.java




I hope you enjoy some of my favourite music made by my favourite composers!
